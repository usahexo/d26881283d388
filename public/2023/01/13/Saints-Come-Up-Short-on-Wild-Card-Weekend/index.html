      		<h1 id="Saints-Come-Up-Short-on-Wild-Card-Weekend"><a href="#Saints-Come-Up-Short-on-Wild-Card-Weekend" class="headerlink" title="Saints Come Up Short on Wild Card Weekend"></a>Saints Come Up Short on Wild Card Weekend</h1><p>It was a disappointing ending for the New Orleans Saints, who suffered a last-minute loss to the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Drew Brees threw for over 350 yards and two touchdowns, but it wasn’t enough as the Saints offense was unable to get into the end zone in the final minutes.</p>
<p>The Saints defense played well throughout, but they were ultimately undone by a late touchdown pass from Case Keenum to Stefon Diggs.</p>
<p>New Orleans will now have some time to reflect on another playoff disappointment, and they will need to find ways to improve if they hope to make another run next season.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Year-Another-Playoff-Run-Cut-Short-for-New-Orleans"><a href="#Another-Year-Another-Playoff-Run-Cut-Short-for-New-Orleans" class="headerlink" title="Another Year, Another Playoff Run Cut Short for New Orleans"></a>Another Year, Another Playoff Run Cut Short for New Orleans</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans’ 2018-19 season ended much earlier than anticipated. After making it to the playoffs for the first time in a few years last season, the Pelicans were eliminated in the first round this year by the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>This was a disappointing end to what had been an exciting season for New Orleans. Led by superstar Anthony Davis, the Pelicans had high hopes of making a deep playoff run this year. However, they were ultimately no match for the Warriors.</p>
<p> Davis put up some impressive numbers during the series against Golden State, but it was not enough to propel New Orleans to victory. In the end, the Warriors proved to be too much for them.</p>
<p>This was a frustrating end to what had been a promising season for the Pelicans. They will now have to regroup and figure out how to build on this disappointing finish going forward.</p>
<p>Davis is still one of the most talented players in the NBA, and he is sure to lead New Orleans back into playoff contention in future seasons. With him at the helm, there is no reason why the Pelicans can’t reach new heights in 2019-20 and beyond.</p>
<h1 id="Saints-Fall-Just-Short-in-Race-to-the-Playoffs"><a href="#Saints-Fall-Just-Short-in-Race-to-the-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Saints Fall Just Short in Race to the Playoffs"></a>Saints Fall Just Short in Race to the Playoffs</h1><p>NEW ORLEANS - The Saints were just a hair out of the playoffs this year, coming up just short in their race to the postseason.</p>
<p>It was a tough season for New Orleans, as they battled injuries and inconsistency throughout the year. But with some big wins at the end of the season, the Saints nearly made it into the playoffs.</p>
<p>Their final game of the year was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it was a close one. The Saints ultimately lost by 3 points, making their record 10-6 on the year.</p>
<p>It was an impressive run by New Orleans, who had to battle through some major injuries to key players like Drew Brees and Alvin Kamara. But with some strong performances down the stretch, they showed that they can compete with anyone in the league.</p>
<p>The Saints will look to build on this success next season and make a run for the Super Bowl. They have a ton of talent on their roster, and with some improvements they should be right in the mix for a championship.</p>
<p>That’s looking ahead though, and for now all New Orleans fans can do is reflect on an exciting season that just fell short. There were plenty of highs and lows throughout 2018, but in the end it just wasn’t enough to get into the playoffs.</p>
<p>Still, things are looking bright for this team going forward, so be sure to keep an eye on them next year!</p>
<h1 id="New-Orleans-Saints-Miss-Out-on-Playoff-Berth-by-a-Hair"><a href="#New-Orleans-Saints-Miss-Out-on-Playoff-Berth-by-a-Hair" class="headerlink" title="New Orleans Saints Miss Out on Playoff Berth by a Hair"></a>New Orleans Saints Miss Out on Playoff Berth by a Hair</h1><p>The New Orleans Saints had their 2017 season come to an end much earlier than they had hoped. After a great start to the year that saw them go 8-2, they lost four of their last six games, including their final game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This resulted in them missing out on a playoff berth by just one game.</p>
<p>There were a number of reasons for the Saints’ late-season collapse. One big reason was the play of quarterback Drew Brees. Brees had an MVP-caliber season early on, but he struggled down the stretch. He threw nine interceptions in those last six games after throwing only seven in the first ten games.</p>
<p>Another reason for the Saints’ struggles was their defense. They started off the year giving up less than 20 points per game, but they allowed over 28 points per game in their last six games. This was due in part to injuries to some of their key players, such as linebacker Alex Anzalone and cornerback Marshon Lattimore.</p>
<p>Despite missing out on the playoffs, there were still some positives for the Saints this year. Receiver Michael Thomas established himself as one of the top receivers in the league, totaling 1,405 yards and eight touchdowns. And rookie running back Alvin Kamara was one of the most productive runners in the NFL, totaling 1,554 yards from scrimmage and 13 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a disappointing end to what had been a very good season for the Saints. They will need to make some improvements if they hope to make a return trip to the playoffs in 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Snatching-Defeat-from-the-Jaws-of-Victory-A-Sad-Tale-for-the-New-Orleans-Saints"><a href="#Snatching-Defeat-from-the-Jaws-of-Victory-A-Sad-Tale-for-the-New-Orleans-Saints" class="headerlink" title="Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory: A Sad Tale for the New Orleans Saints"></a>Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory: A Sad Tale for the New Orleans Saints</h1><p>It looked as if the New Orleans Saints had finally pulled off a win. With only seconds left in the game, they were ahead of the Los Angeles Rams by a single point. The excitement was palpable.</p>
<p>But then disaster struck.</p>
<p>On the last play of the game, Rams quarterback Jared Goff threw a long pass downfield to wide receiver Brandin Cooks. Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore tried to intercept the ball, but instead he tipped it straight into Cooks’s hands. Cooks then ran the rest of the way to the end zone for a touchdown, giving the Rams a dramatic victory.</p>
<p>The loss was particularly devastating for New Orleans because they had seemed to be in control of the game throughout most of its duration. They had outplayed the Rams in every way possible, except for one crucial mistake near the end. Now their season was essentially over; they would not be able to make it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that the Saints had blown a winning lead late in a game. In fact, it seemed to be becoming something of a habit for them. And that is why many people were already calling this latest loss “the worst choke job in NFL history.”</p>
<p>It is hard not to feel sorry for the Saints after such a heartbreaking defeat. They had worked so hard all season only to come up short in the end. Fans will no doubt be hoping that they can put this experience behind them and come back stronger next year.</p>
