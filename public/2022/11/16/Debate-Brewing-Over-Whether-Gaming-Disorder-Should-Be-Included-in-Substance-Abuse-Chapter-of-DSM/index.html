      		<h1 id="Debate-Brewing-Over-Whether-Gaming-Disorder-Should-Be-Included-in-Substance-Abuse-Chapter-of-DSM"><a href="#Debate-Brewing-Over-Whether-Gaming-Disorder-Should-Be-Included-in-Substance-Abuse-Chapter-of-DSM" class="headerlink" title="Debate Brewing Over Whether Gaming Disorder Should Be Included in Substance Abuse Chapter of DSM"></a>Debate Brewing Over Whether Gaming Disorder Should Be Included in Substance Abuse Chapter of DSM</h1><p>The World Health Organization’s (WHO) upcoming publication of the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases, ICD-11, is sparking debate on whether gaming disorder should be included in the substance abuse chapter.</p>
<p>Gaming disorder was proposed for inclusion in ICD-11 by a WHO working group that included experts from around the world. The proposed disorder is characterized by impaired control over gaming, increased priority given to gaming over other activities and significant distress or impairment caused by gaming.</p>
<p>Despite controversy, many experts believe that gaming disorder should be recognized as a mental health condition. Dr. Vladimir Poznyak, who chaired the WHO working group that proposed gaming disorder for inclusion in ICD-11, believes that recognizing gaming disorder will help people with the condition get treatment.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a harmless diversion,” said Poznyak in an interview with CBC News. “Excessive gaming is actually having a negative impact on people’s lives — their personal lives, social lives, educational lives and occupational lives.”</p>
<p>Others argue that there is not enough evidence to support recognizing gaming disorder as a mental health condition. Some say that excessive video gaming may simply be a symptom of another underlying problem like depression or anxiety and should not be treated separately.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding whether or not to recognize gaming disorder as a mental health condition highlights some of the challenges associated with classifying new disorders. There is no gold standard for diagnosis and it can be difficult to distinguish between normal and pathological behavior. In addition, there is often debate about where to draw the line between disordered and healthy behavior.</p>
<p>ICD-11 is currently in draft form and will be finalized later this year. Gaming disorder will be included in the substance abuse chapter if it is approved by the WHO Board in June 2018.</p>
<h1 id="7-Professionals-Disagree-on-Whether-Gaming-Disorder-Should-be-Considered-a-Mental-Health-Condition"><a href="#7-Professionals-Disagree-on-Whether-Gaming-Disorder-Should-be-Considered-a-Mental-Health-Condition" class="headerlink" title="7. Professionals Disagree on Whether Gaming Disorder Should be Considered a Mental Health Condition"></a>7. Professionals Disagree on Whether Gaming Disorder Should be Considered a Mental Health Condition</h1><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that Gaming Disorder will be recognized as a mental health condition in the 11th edition of its International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This has sparked intense debate among professionals, who are divided on whether gaming disorder should be considered a mental health condition.</p>
<p>On one side of the debate are those who argue that gaming disorder is a real phenomenon that warrants recognition as a mental health condition. They contend that gaming disorder can cause significant adverse effects on a person’s life, including social isolation, academic decline, and even suicide.</p>
<p>Others, however, argue that gaming disorder is not a real condition and that it is being over-diagnosed. They claim that the vast majority of people who gaming disorder do not suffer any adverse effects from their gaming habit and that there is no need to pathologize normal behavior.</p>
<p>So, what is the truth about Gaming Disorder? Is it a legitimate mental health condition or is it being over-diagnosed? The answer to this question remains unclear, as there is still much research needed to determine whether or not gaming disorder is truly a mental health condition. However, what is clear is that there is significant disagreement among professionals on this issue.</p>
<h1 id="2-Debate-Continues-Over-whether-Gaming-Disorder-is-a-Legitimate-Condition"><a href="#2-Debate-Continues-Over-whether-Gaming-Disorder-is-a-Legitimate-Condition" class="headerlink" title="2. Debate Continues Over whether Gaming Disorder is a Legitimate Condition"></a>2. Debate Continues Over whether Gaming Disorder is a Legitimate Condition</h1><p>Diagnoses of video game addiction and Gaming Disorder have been around for a while but have only recently been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) by the American Psychiatric Association. This has led to a great deal of debate over whether Gaming Disorder is a legitimate mental health condition.</p>
<p>Those who support the inclusion of Gaming Disorder in the DSM argue that it is a real and serious condition that can cause significant impairment in a person’s life. They point to research that shows increased rates of anxiety, depression, and problems with socialization among people who Game Disorder.</p>
<p>Others who oppose the inclusion of Gaming Disorder in DSM argue that there is not enough evidence to support its classification as a mental health condition. They say that many people who game excessively do not experience any negative consequences and that it is not appropriate to pathologize normal behavior.</p>
<p>So what is the truth? Is Gaming Disorder a real condition or not?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer to this question at this point. However, there is certainly enough evidence to suggest that Gaming Disorder is a real and serious problem for some people. It is important to note that not everyone who games excessively experiences negative consequences, but for those who do, it can be quite serious.</p>
<p>If you are concerned that you or someone you know may have Gaming Disorder, it is important to seek help from a qualified professional. There are treatments available that can help you manage your addiction and improve your quality of life.</p>
<h1 id="3-Some-Professionals-Believe-Gaming-Disorder-Should-be-Included-in-the-Substance-Abuse-Chapter-of-DSM"><a href="#3-Some-Professionals-Believe-Gaming-Disorder-Should-be-Included-in-the-Substance-Abuse-Chapter-of-DSM" class="headerlink" title="3. Some Professionals Believe Gaming Disorder Should be Included in the Substance Abuse Chapter of DSM"></a>3. Some Professionals Believe Gaming Disorder Should be Included in the Substance Abuse Chapter of DSM</h1><p>Since the early days of gaming, people have been debating on whether or not it can be considered an addiction. And while there is no one-size-fits-all answer, many experts believe that gaming disorder should be included in the substance abuse chapter of DSM.</p>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is a comprehensive guide used by mental health professionals to classify and diagnose mental disorders. Gaming disorder was first proposed for inclusion in DSM-5 in 2013, but it was ultimately rejected. However, the World Health Organization recently recognized gaming disorder as a legitimate mental health condition, so there is a good chance that it will be included in DSM-6.</p>
<p>There are two main criteria for diagnosing gaming disorder: impaired control over gaming and increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that it takes precedence over other activities and commitments. People with gaming disorder may spend excessive amounts of time playing video games, neglect their responsibilities, suffer from mood swings or anxiety when they can’t game, and even experience withdrawal symptoms when they’re unable to play.</p>
<p>Some people argue that gaming disorder isn’t really a mental health condition – it’s just a hobby gone too far. But for people who are truly addicted to video games, their lives can be seriously disrupted by their obsession. Gaming disorder can cause problems at school or work, strain relationships, and lead to social isolation.</p>
<p>If you think you might have gaming disorder, please seek professional help. Treatment typically includes counseling and&#x2F;or therapy, as well as behavioral interventions to help you manage your addiction. With proper treatment, you can learn how to live without video games and regain control of your life.</p>
<h1 id="4-Gaming-Addiction-Could-Soon-be-Classified-as-a-Substance-Abuse-Disorder"><a href="#4-Gaming-Addiction-Could-Soon-be-Classified-as-a-Substance-Abuse-Disorder" class="headerlink" title="4. Gaming Addiction Could Soon be Classified as a Substance Abuse Disorder"></a>4. Gaming Addiction Could Soon be Classified as a Substance Abuse Disorder</h1><p>Gaming addiction could soon be classified as a mental health disorder, if recent reports are to be believed.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), gaming disorder is characterized by “a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour” that takes precedence over other activities and results in negative consequences in personal, social, educational, or occupational functioning.</p>
<p>In other words, if you’re spending so much time playing video games that it’s impacting your wellbeing and ability to function normally in other areas of your life, you may have a gaming disorder.</p>
<p>The WHO has been considering adding gaming disorder to its list of mental health conditions for some time now, and it seems likely that the organization will make a decision this year.</p>
<p>If gaming disorder is officially recognised as a mental health disorder, it will join conditions such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and substance abuse disorders. This could mean that people with a gaming disorder will be able to access treatment through their healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Many experts believe that gaming addiction is a real problem that deserves to be taken seriously. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests that gaming addiction can be just as harmful as drug or alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>People with a gaming disorder may experience the same symptoms as people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol. These symptoms include cravings for the game, inability to control how much time is spent playing, withdrawal symptoms when not playing, and negative consequences as a result of playing (e.g., problems with school or work, decreased physical activity, isolation from friends and family).</p>
<p>If you think you might have a gaming addiction, it’s important to get help. There are many resources available online and through your healthcare provider.</p>
<h1 id="5-Experts-Weigh-In-On-Whether-Gaming-Disorder-Belongs-In-The-Substance-Abuse-Chapter"><a href="#5-Experts-Weigh-In-On-Whether-Gaming-Disorder-Belongs-In-The-Substance-Abuse-Chapter" class="headerlink" title="5. Experts Weigh In On Whether Gaming Disorder Belongs In The Substance Abuse Chapter"></a>5. Experts Weigh In On Whether Gaming Disorder Belongs In The Substance Abuse Chapter</h1><p>In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), gaming disorder is listed as a condition that may be diagnosed when a person’s “video gaming habits interfere with other aspects of their life.” This has led to some debate about whether or not gaming disorder should be classified as a type of substance abuse.</p>
<p>Now, a group of experts has weighed in on the matter, and their verdict is that gaming disorder does belong in the substance abuse chapter. In a letter addressed to the WHO, they argue that video gaming meets all of the criteria for substance abuse, including loss of control, cravings, and damaging consequences.</p>
<p>The experts who signed the letter are from a variety of backgrounds, including addiction medicine, psychiatry, and mental health. They note that there is growing evidence that video gaming can be addictive and damaging to people’s lives.</p>
<p>One study found that people who played games for more than three hours a day were more likely to exhibit signs of addiction. The study also found that these individuals were more likely to suffer from lower levels of satisfaction with their lives and poorer mental health overall.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown that video gaming can lead to problems such as obesity, poor grades, and social isolation. The experts who signed the letter argue that all of these negative consequences warrant classifying gaming disorder as a type of substance abuse.</p>
<p>The WHO is currently reviewing its classification system for addictive behaviors, and it is possible that gaming disorder will be reclassified as an official addiction in the near future.</p>
