#  UAE Sports Betting Firm Aims to Attract Global Players 

A sports betting company in the United Arab Emirates is looking to expand its business and attract international players. The company, known as “X”, is hoping to capitalize on the rapidly growing online gambling market, which is expected to be worth $81.5 billion by 2020.

According to a recent report by Newzoo, the global market for online gambling was worth $46.5 billion in 2017, and it is forecast to grow at a rate of 8.8% per year. X plans to compete with the leading companies in this industry by offering a superior user experience and a wide range of betting options.

The company has already secured licenses in several countries, including the UK, Malta, and Denmark. It is currently working on expanding into new markets, such as Canada and the United States. In addition, X is developing innovative products that will appeal to a global audience.

One of these products is a virtual reality casino that allows players to interact with real dealers in real time. This gives players the feel of being in a physical casino while still enjoying all the benefits of online gambling.

X also offers a unique betting platform that allows customers to bet on events that are not covered by traditional bookmakers. This includes everything from politics to entertainment shows.

The company has ambitious plans for growth and hopes to become one of the leading operators in the online gambling market. With its strong focus on innovation and customer experience, X appears well positioned for success.

#  UAE Firm Set to Launch Online Sportsbook

A UAE-based company is all set to launch an online sports betting platform in the country. The company, which has remained unnamed until now, is reported to have obtained a gambling licence from the UAE's regulator earlier this year.

According to the reports, the new sportsbook will allow punters to bet on a range of local and international sporting events including football, cricket, tennis and golf. It is understood that the platform will also offer in-play betting and a wide range of betting options.

The news comes as a growing number of operators are looking to enter the burgeoning eSports market in the region. Earlier this year, Swiss gaming company William Hill entered into a partnership with major regional telecom operator du to launch an online sports betting platform in Qatar.

It's not just traditional sports that are attracting the interest of online gambling companies though. In February this year, Dubai-based start-up SportyCo announced it had secured $2 million in funding to develop its blockchain-based sports investment platform. The platform will allow individuals to invest in professional athletes and clubs, with users being able to earn a share of their sporting success in return.

#  UAE Gambling Firm Enters Sports Betting Market

A UAE-based online gambling company has announced its plans to enter the sports betting market.

The firm, which operates under the name of Aplay, said that it will offer a range of sports betting services, including in-play betting and Live Casino products.

It also revealed that it has entered into a strategic partnership with leading UK-based gaming supplier Playtech, which will see it benefit from the supplier’s experience and expertise in the sports betting market.
