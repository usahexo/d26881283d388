#  How much does it cost?

The cost of a wedding can vary greatly depending on location, the size of the event, the type of ceremony and reception, and the number of guests. However, on average, Americans spend about $27,000 on their weddings.

#  The Venue

One of the most important decisions you'll make when planning your wedding is choosing a venue. The venue will set the tone for your entire wedding and determine many of the other details like how many guests you can invite and what type of caterer you can use. Venue prices can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, so it's important to do your research and decide what's most important to you.

#  The Caterer

Food is a big part of any wedding celebration, so finding the right caterer is essential. Caterers typically charge by the person, so be sure to get an estimate based on the number of guests you're expecting. You'll also want to consider what type of food you want served and whether you want a buffet or seated dinner.

#  The Photographer

Your wedding photos are going to be one of your most cherished memories from your big day, so it's important to choose a photographer you trust. Photographers typically charge by the hour, so be sure to ask for an estimate based on how many hours you'll need them for.

Additionally, if you ever have a question that you don't know how to answer, ELI5 provides a place where you can ask anyone anything. This can be useful when you're curious about something but don't want to search for an answer online yourself.
