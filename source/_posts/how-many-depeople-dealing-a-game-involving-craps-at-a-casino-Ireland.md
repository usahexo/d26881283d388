#  how many depeople dealing a game involving craps at a casino Ireland

There is no definitive answer to this question as it will depend on the individual casino, and the craps game itself. However, in general, the house edge for craps is around 1.4%, so for every €100 you gamble, you can expect to lose around €1.40. This figure may vary depending on the specific game being played and the bets made.

It's important to understand that while craps offers relatively good odds compared to other casino games, it's still a game of chance and there is no guarantee of winning. So if you're planning to gamble at a casino, it's always best to set yourself a limit and stick to it, no matter how tempting it might be to keep betting in an attempt to win back your losses.

#  how to play craps at the casino Ireland

Craps is one of the most exciting casino games. It is a fast-paced game that offers players a lot of excitement and chances to win big. If you are new to craps, this guide will teach you how to play the game.

Before you start playing craps, you need to understand the basic rules of the game. In craps, players bet on the outcome of a roll of two dice. The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins. There are a number of different bets that you can make in craps, and each one has its own odds and payout.

The most common bet in craps is called the pass line bet. With this bet, you are betting that the dice will roll a 7 or 11 on the first roll. If they do, you win even money. If they roll 2, 3, or 12, you lose your bet. If they roll any other number, that becomes your point number. You then continue to bet on whether or not the point number will be rolled again before a 7 is rolled. If it is rolled again before a 7, you win; if not, you lose your bet.

There are also other types of bets that you can make in craps, including prop bets and odds bets. Prop bets are specific bets that cover a range of outcomes on a particular roll of the dice. For example, you can place a prop bet on whether or not the dice will land on a particular number or whether either one will show as double digits. Odds bets are made after a point has been established and allow you to wager more money on whether or not the point will be hit again before a 7 is rolled.
