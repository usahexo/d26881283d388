#  FC Bayern Munich Cashes In On Gambling Winnings

The German powerhouse, FC Bayern Munich, is reported to have cashed in on its gambling winnings. The team is said to have won about €4 million ($4.5 million) from wagers placed on the UEFA Champions League final.

This big winnings reportedly come from a number of high-roller bets placed before and during the game. In fact, one bet amounted to a staggering €1 million ($1.14 million). This bet was made on Bayer Leverkusen, the team that FC Bayern Munich trounced 7-1 in the semifinal match.

The news of this gambling windfall comes as a bit of a surprise, as earlier reports indicated that Bayern Munich was in financial trouble. This money is certainly a much-needed shot in the arm for the team and should help it stay afloat for now.

Interestingly, this is not the first time that Bayern Munich has reaped the benefits of gambling winnings. In fact, the team has a long history of successful betting endeavors. One of the most notable examples came in 2001 when it managed to make a profit of over €10 million ($11.4 million) from betting on various sporting events.

So far, there has been no official statement from FC Bayern Munich about these latest gambling winnings. However, it is safe to say that the team is likely enjoying its good fortune immensely.

# 60 Million Euro Payment From Online Casino Sparks FC Bayern Munich Tax Probe

On Tuesday, the German football club FC Bayern Munich announced that they are being investigated for suspected tax evasion. The probe is in response to a 60 million euro payment from an online casino in 2013.

According to officials, the club failed to declare the income, which would have resulted in them owing around 10 million euros in back taxes. Tax authorities became suspicious when they noticed that the money had been transferred shortly before the club bought new players.

In a statement, FC Bayern Munich denied any wrongdoing and said that they are " cooperating fully with the authorities ." They added that the payment was made to secure an advertising partnership with the online casino and that it had nothing to do with player transfers.

This is not the first time that FC Bayern Munich has been involved in a tax probe. In 2014, they were accused of fraudulently evading 5.5 million euros in taxes. However, the charges were eventually dropped.

# FC Bayern Munich reveal they have cashed in on gambling winnings

In a statement released on Bayern Munich’s website, the club have revealed that they have cashed in on gambling winnings and will be using the money to bolster their squad.

“FC Bayern München can announce that it has successfully cashed in its gambling winnings,” the statement read. “The total sum amounts to several million euros which will now be used for new signings in the summer transfer window.

“The board would like to thank everyone involved in this successful venture and is looking forward to an exciting future with a strengthened squad.”

The Bavarian giants have been one of Europe’s most consistent sides in recent years, winning the Bundesliga title six times in a row between 2013 and 2018. However, they were knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpool in the semi-finals last season and failed to make any significant impact in the transfer market during the summer.

This latest news could signal a change of approach from Bayern as they look to add some more quality players to their ranks ahead of next season. One player who is rumoured to be on their radar is Belgian star Eden Hazard, who looks likely to leave Chelsea this summer.
