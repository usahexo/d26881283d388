#  Texans have firepower to contend with any team in NFL

Houston Texans have firepower to contend with any team in NFL. Quarterback Deshaun Watson is coming into his own after an impressive rookie year. DeAndre Hopkins is one of the best receivers in the league, and Will Fuller has emerged as a deep threat. The defense is anchored by Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus.

The Texans open the season with a tough matchup against the New England Patriots. But they have enough talent to win any game on their schedule. Houston should be considered a serious contender for the Super Bowl this year.

#  Watt, Clowney make Texans defense one of best in NFL

For the first time in what seems like forever, the Houston Texans have a bona fide defense. After years of investing in offensive players and neglecting their defense, the 2017 offseason saw the Texans finally invest in some defensive talent. This offseason they signed Defensive End J.J. Watt to a six-year extension and drafted Defensive End Jadeveon Clowney with the first overall pick. These two players make up one of the best defensive duos in the NFL.

The addition of Watt and Clowney has made an already good Texan's defense great. In fact, through two games this season, the Texans defense is ranked number one in the NFL in both points allowed (6) and yards allowed (240).

While Watt and Clowney are certainly the headliners on this defense, they are not alone. Other players who have contributed to the Texans' early success include Defensive Backs Johnathan Joseph and Kareem Jackson, Linebackers Brian Cushing and Whitney Mercilus, and Defensive Tackle Vince Wilfork.

Houston's defense will be critical to their success this season. With an offense led by quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and running back Arian Foster, they may not be able to keep up with some of the high-powered offenses in the league. If they can continue to play like they have so far this season, however, they should be able to win a lot of games.

#  Can Watson take Texans to Super Bowl?

 Houston Texans have never been to the Super Bowl. This year, there is a good chance that they can make it to the big game. The biggest reason for this is the addition of Watson to their quarterback roster.

Watson was the rookie of the year in 2017 and showed a lot of promise on the field. He finished his rookie season with 19 touchdowns and almost 2,500 yards. This was despite only playing seven games due to an injury.

Houston has made some other offseason changes that should also help them make it to the Super Bowl. One of these changes was signing Tyrann Mathieu, who is considered one of the best defensive players in the league. They have also added some other talented players on both offense and defense, which should give Watson plenty of support on the field.

There are a few other teams that could give Houston a run for their money in the playoffs this year, but with Watson at the helm, they definitely have a chance to bring home the Super Bowl Championship.

#  Hopkins leads Texans offense with big play potential

Getting off to a hot start is essential for any NFL team, but it’s especially important for the Houston Texans. They are a team that lacks big-play potential on offense, so they need to take advantage of any opportunity they get early in games.

Houston’s starter at quarterback is Deshaun Watson, who had a great rookie season last year before he was injured. Heading into this season, there’s a lot of excitement around him and the Texans offense. And rightfully so, as Watson has the ability to make big plays with his arm and his legs.

One player who could help Watson have a big year is DeAndre Hopkins. He’s one of the best receivers in the NFL, and he has the ability to make huge catches in key moments. Last year, he finished with 1,378 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns.

With Watson back under center and Hopkins as his top target, the Texans have a chance to make some noise in the AFC this season. They may not be able to compete with teams like the Patriots or Steelers, but they should be able to win some games against lesser opponents.

If Watson can stay healthy and Hopkins continues to play at a high level, the Texans offense could surprise a lot of people in 2018.

#  Texans look to establish themselves as top team in AFC

Houston Texans went into the 2017-2018 NFL season with high expectations. The team had finished the previous season with a 9-7 record and narrowly missed out on the playoffs. Many pundits predicted that the Texans would be one of the top teams in the AFC this year and would finally make it to the postseason.

The Texans got off to a good start, winning their first three games. However, they then went on a four-game losing streak, which put them in danger of missing the playoffs. They managed to win their last two games to finish with a 10-6 record and clinch a playoff berth.

In the Wild Card round, they faced the Indianapolis Colts, who they defeated 21-7 to advance to the next round. In the Divisional Round, they faced the defending Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots. The Patriots were heavily favored to win, but the Texans gave them a good fight, losing 36-33 in overtime.

Despite losing in overtime, many people considered this to be a successful season for the Texans. They had made it further than they ever had before and were only one game away from reaching the Super Bowl.

The Texans will hope to build on this success in 2018-2019 and finally make it to the Super Bowl. They have a very talented team and should be one of the favorites to win the AFC this year.
