#  Taking Photos at Caesar's Casino is Now Illegal

Caesar's Casino is no longer allowing members of the public to take photos or videos on its premises. The new policy went into effect on Monday, and is said to be in an effort to protect both the casino and its customers.

A spokesperson for the casino released a statement saying, "We want our customers to enjoy their time at Caesar's Casino, and we don't want them to be distracted by the use of cell phones or cameras. We hope our customers will understand and respect this new policy."

Many people are unhappy with the change, including local photographer Jeff Houghton. "This is a major blow to my business," he said. "I rely on Caesar's Casino as one of my main sources of income."

Others argue that the policy infringes on people's right to free speech. "What if I want to take a picture of the beautiful architecture inside the casino?" asked one woman. "I shouldn't be punished for that."

The spokesperson for Caesar's Casino says that people are still allowed to take pictures outside the casino, but they are not allowed to bring cameras or cell phones inside.

#  Casino Sues Woman for Taking Pictures of Slot Machines

The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, NJ, is suing a woman for taking pictures inside the casino of slot machines. The lawsuit alleges that the woman violated the New Jersey Casino Control Act, which makes it illegal to “use any photographic or other recording device” in a casino.

The Borgata is seeking unspecified damages and attorney fees.

The woman, who has not been identified, says she took the pictures as part of a research project on gambling addiction. She says she was not photographing the individual slot machines but instead was photographing the entire casino floor.

A lawyer for the Borgata says that doesn’t matter. “You can’t take pictures of anything in a casino,” he said. “Even if you don’t photograph any individual machine, you can see what somebody’s playing on and that could be used to influence their play.”

The lawsuit is just the latest example of casinos becoming more aggressive in enforcing their rules against photography. Last year, a man was arrested at the Venetian casino in Las Vegas for taking pictures of a roulette wheel. In 2012, a woman was banned from all casinos in Atlantic City for snapping photos inside the Tropicana casino.

#  Woman Wins Lawsuit Against Casino for Taking Pictures

A woman has won a lawsuit against a casino after they took pictures of her while she was gambling. The woman, who is only identified as Jane Doe in the lawsuit, claims that the casino violated her right to privacy.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court and states that the casino used the photos to create a database of problem gamblers. The woman also alleges that the casino used the photos to harass her and her family.

The casino has denied all of the woman's allegations and is fighting the lawsuit. A spokesman for the casino said that they take privacy seriously and that any photos taken were done so legally and in accordance with their privacy policy.

The woman is seeking damages from the casino for violating her rights. This is the first time that a person has sued a casino over this type of issue.

#  Casino Loses Lawsuit to Woman Who Took Pictures of Slot Machines

The owners of a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, have lost a lawsuit brought by a woman who took pictures of slot machines. The woman, who is from Massachusetts, says she takes the pictures to prove that the slot machines are not paying out as they should.

The casino, which has not been named in the media, claims that the woman was photographing the machines in order to cheat them out of money. However, the woman says that she has never won anything while playing at the casino and only takes pictures to ensure that she is not being taken advantage of.

A judge ruled in favor of the woman last week, stating that she had a right to take pictures of public property. The casino has said that it will appeal the ruling.

#  Woman Can Now Take Pictures of Slot Machines at Caesar's Casino

The New Jersey Casino Control Commission has ruled that a woman can take pictures of slot machines at Caesar's casino in Atlantic City.

The ruling overturns a decision made by the casino last year that said photography was not allowed, even if the images were taken from outside the property.

The commission ruled that the policy violated state anti-discrimination laws.

"We are gratified by this outcome and appreciate the Commission's recognition of our efforts to ensure all our guests are treated equitably," said Caesar's spokeswoman Jennifer Weissman.

Under the previous policy, casino officials said they were trying to stop people from taking pictures of slot machines and then going to other casinos to try to learn how to play the games.
