If you want to be successful as a drink girl in Las Vegas, it’s important to remember two key things: you need to be attractive and you need to be willing to work hard. The Tough Rock Casino is a great place to start if you’re looking to make some serious money in Sin City!

#  Drink Girls Bring in Millions for Casino Bosses

Casino bosses count on the drinking habits of their female customers to bring in millions of dollars in revenue every year.

Gambling experts say that women place more value on their social interactions than men, and casinos know how to capitalize on this by offering them alcohol for free.

Some casinos even have bars that are open late into the night, specifically targeting women who are looking to drink and party.

One casino executive said that as much as 30% of the casino’s profits can come from women who are drinking.

And it’s not just the casino bosses who benefit from all the drinking – cocktail waitresses also make big bucks in tips.

In fact, one waitress at a Las Vegas casino said she can easily make $1,000 in tips over the course of a weekend.

So if you’re looking to make some money while you’re gambling, it might be worth hitting up the casino bar!

#  How Much Do Drink Girls Make at Tough Rock Casino? 

The drink girls at Tough Rock Casino make a good wage. They start out making $10 an hour and can make up to $15 an hour with tips. This is a good wage for any job, but especially for one that requires little training and involves interacting with people. The casino could probably raise the starting wage even higher and still have plenty of people interested in the job, but they choose to keep it at $10 because it is still more than most other places are paying.

They are always friendly and happy to help, which makes them popular with customers. The casino could not function without them, so they are definitely worth the money that they make.
