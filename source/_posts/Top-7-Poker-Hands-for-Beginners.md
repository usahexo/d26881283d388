#  The Best 3 Poker Hands for Intermediate Players

So, you have a basic understanding of poker hands and what beats what. But what are the best hands for intermediate players?

Here are the top three hands for intermediate poker players:

1. A high pair (Aces or Kings)
2. Two pair
3. A straight or flush

Let's take a closer look at each of these hands and how to play them.

1. A high pair (Aces or Kings)
This is one of the strongest hands in poker, and you should always aim to get as much money into the pot as possible with it. If you are playing against one or two other opponents, try to make a full house or four of a kind. If there are more opponents, then go for a set (three of a kind).

2. Two pair
Two pair can be a very strong hand, especially if the two pairs are matching (e.g., two Queens or two Aces). In this case, you should generally try to make a full house if possible. If there are more opponents, then go for a set (three of a kind). Be careful though – if an opponent has four of a kind, then your two pair will lose!

3. A straight or flush
A straight or flush can also be a very strong hand, especially if it is Ace-high. In this case, you should always aim to get as much money into the pot as possible. If you are playing against one or two other opponents, try to make four of a kind or better. If there are more opponents, then go for a full house.

#  What are the Odds of Getting These 7 Poker Hands?

We've all seen the poker hands chart on TV, in the movies, and even at the casino. But what are the odds of actually getting each hand?

# Royal Flush
The odds of being dealt a royal flush are about 1 in 649,740 hands. This is by far the most rare hand in poker and means you're holding an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten of the same suit.

# Straight Flush
A straight flush is five cards in consecutive order all of the same suit. The odds of being dealt this hand are about 1 in 72,193 hands.

# Four of a Kind
Four of a kind occurs when you are dealt four cards of the same rank. The odds of this happening are about 1 in 4,165 hands.

# Full House
A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand occurs about once every 7 hands.

# Flush
A flush is five cards of the same suit but not in consecutive order. The odds of being dealt this hand are about 1 in 50 hands.

#  10 Poker Hands Everyone Should Know

In poker, there are 10 hands that are considered the most powerful and important to know. Called “the big 10”, these hands are made up of different combinations of pocket cards and community cards. If you want to be a successful poker player, it is crucial to understand the strength and value of each hand.

Here is a look at each of the 10 big hands, along with examples of how they might play out in a real game:

1. Pocket Aces

Also called “American Airlines”, pocket aces are the top hand in poker. They consist of two aces and are almost always played as a pre-flop all-in. If you are fortunate enough to have pocket aces, make sure you bet big and scare your opponents off.

2. Pocket Kings

Pocket kings are also considered very strong, as they contain two kings – which is the second highest pair possible. Like pocket aces, they should be played aggressively pre-flop in order to build up the pot.

3. Pocket Queens

Pocket queens are another high pair that can be very dangerous if played correctly. Because there are so many ways for this hand to win (e.g., straights, flushes), it’s important to be aggressive when holding queens and betting large sums when possible.

4. A full house

A full house is made up of three of one number and two of another number (e.g., three sixes and two twos). This hand can be very powerful if played correctly, as it has several winning possibilities. When playing against others with full houses, remember that your chances of winning decrease as more cards are revealed.

5. Four of a kind

Four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank (e.g., four queens). This is an extremely rare hand that can beat any other combination except for a royal flush or five of a kind. As such, it’s important to bet big when playing foursomes – especially if you think your opponents may not have anything better than a pair.
