#  Cardinals favored to win against Falcons, but reversed line movement could indicate betting upset

The Arizona Cardinals are favored to win against the Atlanta Falcons this weekend, but the line movement indicates that there may be an upset in the works.

The Cardinals opened as 3.5-point favorites, but the line has now shifted to make the Falcons slight favorites. This suggests that there may be some betting action on Atlanta to pull off the upset.

If this is indeed the case, then it could be a good opportunity to bet on the Falcons. They have been playing well lately and have a strong defense that can keep them in the game against Arizona.

The Cardinals have been struggling offensively in recent weeks, which could lead to an upset victory for Atlanta.

#  Cardinals see big reverse line movement ahead of showdown with Packers

Las Vegas is anticipating a big game from the Green Bay Packers this weekend as they take on the Arizona Cardinals. The Packers are currently three-point favorites, but the line movement has been all in one direction.

Since opening at -3 a week ago, the Packers have seen almost 60 percent of all bets placed on this game come in on their side. In fact, the line has now shifted to -5 at some sportsbooks, with much of that money coming in from sharps and professionals.

The Cardinals could be catching points for a reason. While they are one of the best teams in the league, they have been inconsistent as of late. After starting the season 6-0, they have since gone just 2-4 and failed to cover in each of their last three games.

On the other hand, the Packers come into this game hot off of their impressive 38-10 victory over the Chicago Bears on Thursday Night Football. That win improved their record to 6-2 and pushed them to -1 favorites in the NFC North Division.

A matchup between these two historic franchises is always entertaining, but it looks like this one could be a blowout. The Cardinals may be able to keep it close early on, but look for Aaron Rodgers and company to pull away in the second half en route to a double-digit victory.

#  After opening as a small favorite, Cardinals now seeing reverse line movement from bettors

The St. Louis Cardinals were opened as a -145 favorite on the moneyline at home against the Miami Marlins, but the line has since shifted to the Marlins being favored by a slim margin of +125.

The Cardinals have been struggling lately, losing six of their last ten games, while the Marlins have been playing much better, winning six of their last ten games. This is likely contributing to the line movement, with bettors believing that there is value on taking Miami at this price.

Both teams have been good offensively this season, with the Cardinals ranking eighth in runs scored and the Marlins ranking 11th. However, the Cardinals have been much better defensively, ranking fourth in defensive efficiency while the Marlins rank 19th. This could be another factor in why bettors are favoring Miami in this game.

The Cardinals will send Miles Mikolas to the mound to face off against Caleb Smith of the Marlins. Mikolas has been excellent this season, posting a 2.85 ERA and 1.09 WHIP while Smith has a 4.19 ERA and 1.37 WHIP this season. Based on these numbers, it would appear that the Marlins are getting some value on their moneyline bet in this game.

#  Cardinals a big underdog, but could see reverse line movement if they pull off the upset

The Cardinals were a big underdog in their Wild Card matchup against the Falcons, but they could see reverse line movement if they pull off the upset.

Atlanta is favored by seven points in this game, but the Cardinals could see some books start to move the line if they manage to win. This would be a major upset, but it’s not out of the question. The Falcons have had a disappointing season, while the Cardinals have played well down the stretch.

If you’re looking to back the Cardinals in this game, you should do so sooner rather than later. The line is likely to move if they manage to pull off the upset, and you don’t want to miss out on potential value.

#  Why is there reverse line movement on the Arizona Cardinals game?

The Cardinals opened up as a 2-point favorite at home against the 49ers, but the line has since swung in favor of the 49ers, now making them a 1-point favorite.

So what’s going on?

Some sports betting experts are attributing the reverse line movement to sharp money coming in on the 49ers. San Francisco is coming off a big win over the Packers last week and could be getting overlooked by some bettors looking to back Arizona.

Others believe that this could be a case of square money taking the Cardinals and pushing the line in their favor. The public typically likes to back favorites at home, so it’s possible that we could see the line move back in favor of Arizona as game time approaches.

No matter which team you’re rooting for, it will be interesting to see how this one plays out. Be sure to keep an eye on the line as kickoff gets closer!
