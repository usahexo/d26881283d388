#  How did the American League West come to be? 

The American League West is one of the Major League Baseball divisions. The division was formed in 1969 as a result of the league's expansion to twelve teams. Teams in the division are the Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Oakland Athletics, and Seattle Mariners.

The Astros were originally part of the National League West from 1962-1969. They were moved to the newly-formed AL West after the league's expansion. The Angels were also an original National League team, playing from 1961-1966. They too moved to the AL West after the league's expansion.

The Rangers joined the American League as an expansion team in 1972. They were originally part of the AL East before being moved to the AL West in 1994. The A's were also an expansion team, joining MLB in 1968. They were originally part of the American League West but moved to Oakland (AL East) in 1971. The Mariners were a franchise created as part of MLB's expansion in 1977 and they too went to the AL West that year.

#  How do teams in the American League West interact with each other? 

After a 162-game season, the regular season is over and it is time for the MLB playoffs. The playoffs are a series of matchups in which the best teams from each division compete against each other in order to determine which team will become the World Series Champion. There are ten teams in the American League, and five of them are in the American League West Division. The teams in this division are: The Houston Astros, The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, The Oakland Athletics, The Seattle Mariners, and The Texas Rangers.

The Houston Astros finished first in the division with a record of 101-61. They were followed by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (80-82), who finished in second place. The Oakland Athletics (75-87) finished in third place, and they were followed by the Seattle Mariners (78-84) and the Texas Rangers (78-84), who both finished with identical records. This means that there was a three-way tie for fourth place.

Since there are only five teams in the division, one team had to be eliminated based on their record. That team was the Seattle Mariners. This means that the Texas Rangers finished fifth place in the division.

The Astros will face off against the Yankees in the ALDS, while the Angels will face off against the Red Sox. The Athletics will face off against the Twins, and the Rangers will face off against the Blue Jays.

#  What regional rivalries exist within the American League West? 



The American League West is one of the most competitive divisions in all of baseball. The division features four teams that are all vying for a playoff spot, and the rivalry between those teams is intense.

The Los Angeles Angels and the Oakland Athletics have been rivals since the 1970s. The two teams are located just a few hours from each other, and they regularly compete for market share in Northern California. The two teams also battle for players, as they are both located in close proximity to talent-rich areas.

The Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros have been rivals since the Astros joined the American League in 2013. The Rangers have consistently been one of the best teams in baseball, while the Astros have struggled in recent years. However, the Astros seem to be on the rise, and they should provide a formidable challenge to the Rangers in the coming years.

The Seattle Mariners and the Vancouver Canadians have been rivals since 1995. The Mariners are based in Seattle, while the Canadians are based in Vancouver. The two teams have competed for fans and players over the years, and their rivalry has intensified since both teams joined the American League West in 2013.

#  What are some of the key strategies teams use in order to win the American League West? 

There are many different strategies teams use in order to win the American League West. Some teams may focus on scoring a lot of runs, while others may focus on pitching and defense. However, there are a few key strategies that seem to work best for most teams in the division.

One key strategy is to have a strong starting rotation. A good starting rotation can help keep the other team from scoring too many runs, and can also give the team a chance to win Game 1 of a series. Additionally, having a strong bullpen can also be important. The bullpen can help shut down the other team in late innings and give the team a chance to win games.

Another key strategy is to have a good lineup. A good lineup can help score runs and get on base. This will give the team a chance to win games by scoring more runs than the other team. Additionally, having a good bench can also be important. The bench can come into the game when needed and help the team win games.

Finally, it is important for teams in the American League West to play well at home. Home-field advantage can be important in close divisional races. If a team can win most of their home games, they will likely have an advantage over their opponents.

#  How has the competitiveness of the American League West changed over time?

The American League West has always been a competitive division. However, it seems that the competitiveness of the division has changed over time.

The Texas Rangers were once the dominant team in the AL West. However, in recent years they have been overtaken by the Houston Astros. The Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners have also been gaining ground, making the AL West one of the most competitive divisions in baseball.

The Rangers are still a good team, but they no longer appear to be as dominant as they once were. The Astros are now the team to beat in the AL West, and they are poised to make a deep playoff run this year.
